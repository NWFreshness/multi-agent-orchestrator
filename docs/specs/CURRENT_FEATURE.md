# CURRENT_FEATURE

## In progress

### 1.5 — Batch dispatch (`scripts/dispatch.py`)

- Spec: `docs/specs/phase-1/1.5-batch-dispatch.md`
- Branch: `feat/1.5-batch-dispatch` (implementer creates from `main`)
- Status: implementer dispatch pending
- Gate: stdlib-only CLI dispatcher; reads a validated plan, issues
  `subprocess.run([sys.executable, "scripts/run_specialist.py", json], ...)` per
  batch in parallel via `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`; deterministic
  per-specialist logs under `logs/specialists/<id>.<n>.json`; aggregates to
  `logs/orchestration-trace.jsonl`; exit 0/1/2 contract; controller checks
  green; two-stage review passed; squash-merged via PR.

## Completion log (append-only — newest at bottom)

- 2026-10-10 — 1.1 done: SKILL.md scaffold merged as d4dd0b5 via PR #1 (squash).
  Controller checks green + spec PASS + quality APPROVED (3 minor nits; 2 applied
  in-branch, 1 carried). Carry-forward: F1.6 spec must explicitly cover
  output-schema + synthesis contract (quality minor 3).
- 2026-10-10 — 1.2 done: orchestrator spawn contract merged as 9db85d8 via PR #2 (squash).
  Spec PASS + quality APPROVED after one fix cycle (1 Critical + 2 Important + 4 Minor,
  all fixed in ccc2274; controller one-token pre-fix missed the §3 twin — quality caught it).
  Lesson persisted to subagent-driven-development skill (grep twins on reviewer-dictated fixes).
- 2026-10-10 — 1.3 done: archetype catalog merged as 43264df via PR #3 (squash).
  Spec PASS + quality APPROVED (2 non-blocking minors applied in-branch 1be2afe +
  README drift fix). Toolchain note: host python has no pytest (→ 1.4 ships
  --self-test; 1.10 decides unittest-vs-pytest); jsonschema present but D7 locks
  stdlib-only for skill scripts.
- 2026-10-10 — 1.4 done: plan validator merged as 5f5440f via PR #4 (squash).
  Spec PASS after one fix (unhashable dep crash c184be2) + quality APPROVED
  after second fix (C1 iterative _check_nesting + I2/M1/M2/M4 polish 1b504e2).
  C1 was a real contract violation: deep nested JSON (depth ≥1500) would
  RecursionError out of validate() and dump a Python traceback — the
  pre-dispatch gate must NEVER traceback (SKILL.md §6). Fix: iterative DFS with
  MAX_NESTING_DEPTH=64, clean ERROR on overflow, sibling scan continues.
  Lesson: controller probe on depth-200 silently returned PLAN_VALID (no crash,
  no error) — that itself was wrong and the reviewer caught it. Persisted to
  subagent-driven-development: a self-test that returns PASS for adversarial
  input is a false positive, not a green.
